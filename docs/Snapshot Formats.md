# **SNA Format (Snapshot)**

The SNA format is one of the most widely used for snapshots of the ZX Spectrum. Its popularity is due to its simplicity and extended support in emulators. However, it has a known limitation: two bytes of memory can become corrupted because the program counter (PC) is temporarily stored on the stack during the snapshot saving process.

This issue arises because the **PC** register value is "pushed" onto the stack, overwriting two bytes at the stack pointer (**SP**) position. While this usually does not affect the saved program, there can be cases where the stack space is fully in use, which could cause memory corruption. A suggested solution to mitigate this problem is to replace the corrupted bytes with zeros and then increment the stack pointer.

When a snapshot is restored, the program resumes its execution with a **RETN** command, returning control to the point where the snapshot was saved. The **IFF2** register indicates the state of interrupt enablement; when active, it means interrupts were enabled at the time of capture.

### **SNA File Structure (48K)**

| **Offset** | **Size** | **Description** |
|------------|----------|-----------------|
| 0          | 1 byte   | **I** Register  |
| 1          | 8 bytes  | Alternate registers: **HL'**, **DE'**, **BC'**, **AF'** |
| 9          | 10 bytes | Main registers: **HL**, **DE**, **BC**, **IY**, **IX** |
| 19         | 1 byte   | Interrupt register (bit 2 contains **IFF2**, 1 = enabled, 0 = disabled) |
| 20         | 1 byte   | **R** Register  |
| 21         | 4 bytes  | **AF**, **SP** Registers |
| 25         | 1 byte   | Interrupt mode (**IM**) (0 = IM0, 1 = IM1, 2 = IM2) |
| 26         | 1 byte   | Border color (0 to 7) |
| 27         | 49152 bytes | RAM dump from address **16384** to **65535** |

**Total size:** 49179 bytes

### **SNA Format (128K)**

The 128K SNA format is an extension of the 48K format, including additional RAM banks. It also fixes the issue related to the **PC** register, which is now stored in an additional variable instead of being pushed onto the stack.

| **Offset** | **Size** | **Description** |
|------------|----------|-----------------|
| 0          | 27 bytes | SNA Header (identical to the 48K format) |
| 27         | 16 KB    | RAM Bank 5 (paged at address 0xC000) |
| 16411      | 16 KB    | RAM Bank 2 |
| 32795      | 16 KB    | Currently paged RAM bank |
| 49179      | 2 bytes  | **PC** Register |
| 49181      | 1 byte   | **0x7FFD** Port state (paging control) |
| 49182      | 1 byte   | **TR-DOS** ROM paged (1) or not (0) |
| 49183      | 16 KB    | Remaining RAM banks in ascending order (0, 1, 3, 4, 6, 7) |

**Total size:** 131103 or 147487 bytes, depending on the number of banks saved.

#### **Additional Details:**
- The third saved RAM bank is always the currently paged bank, even if it is Bank 5 or 2, meaning the same bank can appear twice in the snapshot.
- The remaining banks are saved in ascending order. For example, if Bank 4 is paged at the time of capture, the file will contain Banks 5, 2, and 4, followed by Banks 0, 1, 3, 6, and 7. Conversely, if Bank 5 is paged at the time of capture, the file will contain Banks 5, 2, and 5, followed by Banks 0, 1, 3, 4, 6, and 7.

### **Cases Where ROM is Included**

In a new variant of the SNA format for **48K**, if the file size is **65563 bytes** instead of the standard **49179 bytes**, it means the snapshot includes a 16KB dump of the ZX Spectrum's ROM. This extra ROM block is stored immediately after the header and before the RAM dump from address **16384** to **65535**. (This variant was introduced by Juan Jos√© Ponteprino in the ESPectrum project.)

In this case, the structure is as follows:

| **Offset** | **Size** | **Description** |
|------------|----------|-----------------|
| 0          | 27 bytes | SNA Header |
| 27         | 16 KB    | ROM dump |
| 16411      | 48 KB    | RAM dump from address 0x4000 to 0xFFFF |

**Total size:** 65563 bytes

# **SP Format**

### Overview

The SP format is used to store programs in the ZX Spectrum's memory. This format includes information about the Z80 processor state and registers, as well as the state of memory and other relevant settings.

### SP File Structure

The SP file is structured as follows:

| **Offset** | **Size** | **Description** |
|------------|----------|-----------------|
| 0          | 2 bytes  | "SP" (0x53, 0x50) Signature. |
| 2          | 1 word   | Program length in bytes (usually 49152 bytes). |
| 4          | 1 word   | Initial program position (usually position 16384). |
| 6          | 1 word   | Z80 BC register. |
| 8          | 1 word   | Z80 DE register. |
| 10         | 1 word   | Z80 HL register. |
| 12         | 1 word   | Z80 AF register. |
| 14         | 1 word   | Z80 IX register. |
| 16         | 1 word   | Z80 IY register. |
| 18         | 1 word   | Z80 BC' register. |
| 20         | 1 word   | Z80 DE' register. |
| 22         | 1 word   | Z80 HL' register. |
| 24         | 1 word   | Z80 AF' register. |
| 26         | 1 byte   | Z80 R (refresh) register. |
| 27         | 1 byte   | Z80 I (interrupt) register. |
| 28         | 1 word   | Z80 SP register. |
| 30         | 1 word   | Z80 PC register. |
| 32         | 1 word   | Reserved for future use, always 0. |
| 34         | 1 byte   | Border color at startup. |
| 35         | 1 byte   | Reserved for future use, always 0. |
| 36         | 1 word   | Status word encoded by bits. Format: |
|            |          | Bit: 15-8: Reserved for future use. |
|            |          | Bit: 7-6: Reserved for internal use, always 0. |
|            |          | Bit: 5: Flash state: 0 - INK ink, PAPER paper; 1 - PAPER ink, INK paper. |
|            |          | Bit: 4: Pending interrupt execution. |
|            |          | Bit: 3: Reserved for future use. |
|            |          | Bit: 2: IFF2 flip-flop (internal use). |
|            |          | Bit: 1: Interrupt mode: 0=IM1; 1=IM2. |
|            |          | Bit: 0: IFF1 flip-flop (interrupt state): 0 - Interrupts disabled (DI); 1 - Interrupts enabled (EI). |

### **Cases Where ROM is Included**

If the SP file includes the ROM, both the "program length" field (offset 2) and the "Initial program position" field (offset 4) are set to 0.

# **Z80 File Format**

The .z80 format is undoubtedly the most widely supported by emulators on all platforms. .z80 files are snapshots of memory; they contain an image of the ZX Spectrum's memory contents at a particular point in time. As a result, they cannot be used to recreate the original tape from a snapshot file but are loaded almost instantly.

The .z80 format was originally developed by Gerton Lunter for his Z80 emulator, and three versions of the format are used, as saved in Z80 versions 1.45 (and earlier), 2.x, and 3.x (and later). For easier notation, they will be referred to as versions 1, 2, and 3 of the format, respectively. Several extensions to the .z80 format have also been made by other emulators.

**Version 1 of the .z80 format** can only save 48K snapshots and has the following header:

| **Offset** | **Size** | **Description** |
|------------|----------|-----------------|
| 0          | 1 byte   | **A** Register |
| 1          | 1 byte   | **F** Register |
| 2          | 1 word   | **BC** register pair (LSB first, i.e., C first) |
| 4          | 1 word   | **HL** register pair |
| 6          | 1 word   | Program counter |
| 8          | 1 word   | Stack pointer |
| 10         | 1 byte   | **I** Register (interrupt register) |
| 11         | 1 byte   | **R** Register (refresh register) (bit 7 is not significant!) |
| 12         | 1 byte   | Flags for **R** Register |
|            |          | Bit 0: Bit 7 of the **R** register |
|            |          | Bit 1-3: Border color |
|            |          | Bit 4: 1=SamRom Basic enabled |
|            |          | Bit 5: 1=Compressed data block |
|            |          | Bit 6-7: No significance |
| 13         | 1 word   | **DE** register pair |
| 15         | 1 word   | **BC'** register pair |
| 17         | 1 word   | **DE'** register pair |
| 19         | 1 word   | **HL'** register pair |
| 21         | 1 byte   | **A'** Register |
| 22         | 1 byte   | **F'** Register |
| 23         | 1 word   | **IY** Register (again LSB first) |
| 25         | 1 word   | **IX** Register |
| 27         | 1 byte   | Interrupt flip-flop, 0=DI, otherwise EI |
| 28         | 1 byte   | **IFF2** (not particularly important...) |
| 29         | 1 byte   | Bit 0-1: Interrupt mode (0, 1, or 2) |
|            |          | Bit 2  : 1=Issue 2 emulation |
|            |          | Bit 3  : 1=Double interrupt frequency |
|            |          | Bit 4-5: 1=High video synchronization |
|            |          |          3=Low video synchronization |
|            |          |          0,2=Normal |
|            |          | Bit 6-7: 0=Cursor/Protek/AGF joystick |
|            |          |          1=Kempston joystick |
|            |          |          2=Left Sinclair 2 joystick (or user-defined for .z80 version 3 files) |
|            |          |          3=Right Sinclair 2 joystick |

For compatibility, if byte 12 equals 255, it should be considered as 1.

After this 30-byte header block, the Spectrum's 48K of memory follows in compressed format (if bit 5 of byte 12 is set). The compression method is very simple: it replaces repetitions of at least five equal bytes with a four-byte code ED ED xx yy, which means "byte yy repeated xx times." Only sequences of at least 5 bytes are encoded. The exception is sequences consisting of ED; if found, even two EDs are encoded as ED ED 02 ED. Finally, any byte directly following a single ED is not taken as part of a block, for example, ED 6*00 is not encoded as ED ED ED 06 00 but as ED 00 ED ED 05 00. The block ends with an end marker, 00 ED ED 00.

**Versions 2 and 3** of .z80 files begin with the same 30-byte header as version 1 files. However, bits 4 and 5 of the flag byte no longer have meaning, and the program counter (bytes 6 and 7) is set to zero to signal a version 2 or 3 file.

After the first 30 bytes, an additional header follows:

| **Offset** | **Size** | **Description** |
|------------|----------|-----------------|
|  * 30      | 1 word   | Length of additional header block (see below) |
|  * 32      | 1 word   | Program counter |
|  * 34      | 1 byte   | Hardware mode (see below) |
|  * 35      | 1 byte   | If in SamRam mode, bitwise state of 74ls259. |
|            |          | For example, bit 6=1 after an OUT 31,13 (=2*6+1) |
|            |          | If in 128 mode, contains the last OUT to 0x7ffd |
|            |          | If in Timex mode, contains the last OUT to 0xf4 |
|  * 36      | 1 byte   | Contains 0xff if the Interface I ROM is paged |
|            |          | If in Timex mode, contains the last OUT to 0xff |
|  * 37      | 1 byte   | Bit 0: 1 if **R** register emulation is enabled |
|            |          | Bit 1: 1 if **LDIR** emulation is enabled |
|            |          | Bit 2: AY sound is in use, even on 48K machines |
|            |          | Bit 6: (if bit 2 is set) Fuller Audio Box emulation |
|            |          | Bit 7: Modify hardware (see below) |
|  * 38      | 1 byte   | Last OUT to port 0xfffd (sound chip register number) |
|  * 39      | 16 bytes | Sound chip register contents |
|    55      | 1 word   | Lower **T** state counter |
|    57      | 1 byte   | Upper **T** state counter |
|    58      | 1 byte   | Spectator (QL emulation) flag byte |
|            |          | Ignored by Z80 when loading, zero when saving |
|    59      | 1 byte   | 0xff if the MGT ROM is paged |
|    60      | 1 byte   | 0xff if the Multiface ROM is paged. Must always be 0. |
|    61      | 1 byte   | 0xff if 0-8191 is ROM, 0 if RAM |
|    62      | 1 byte   | 0xff if 8192-16383 is ROM, 0 if RAM |
|    63      | 5 words  | 5 x User-defined joystick key mappings |
|    73      | 5 words  | 5 x ASCII values: keys corresponding to the mappings above |
|    83      | 1 byte   | MGT type: 0=Disciple+Epson, 1=Disciple+HP, 16=Plus D |
|    84      | 1 byte   | Disciple inhibit button state: 0=out, 0xff=in |
|    85      | 1 byte   | Disciple inhibit flag: 0=ROM pageable, 0xff=no |
| ** 86      | 1 byte   | Last OUT to port 0x1ffd |

The word value at position 30 is 23 for version 2 files, and 54 or 55 for version 3; the fields marked '*' are those present in the version 2 header. The final byte (marked '**') is only present if the value at position 30 is 55.

In general, the fields have the same meaning in version 2 and version 3 files, except for byte 34:

| Value | Meaning in v2   | Meaning in v3    |
|-------|-----------------|------------------|
| 0     | 48k             | 48k              |
| 1     | 48k + Interface | 48k + Interface  |
| 2     | SamRam          | SamRam           |
| 3     | 128k            | 48k + MGT        |
| 4     | 128k + Interface| 128k             |
| 5     | -               | 128k + Interface |
| 6     | -               | 128k + MGT       |

(Curiously, documentation for Z80 versions 3.00 to 3.02 had the entries for 'SamRam' and '48k + MGT' swapped in the second column of the above table; additionally, bytes 61 and 62 of the format were incorrectly documented until version 3.04. Snapshots produced by earlier versions of Z80 followed the above; only the documentation was wrong).

Other emulators have extended the .z80 format to support more machine types:

| Value | Meaning            |
|-------|--------------------|
| 7     | Spectrum +3        |
| 8     | [Misused by some XZX-Pro versions to indicate a +3] |
| 9     | Pentagon (128K)    |
| 10    | Scorpion (256K)    |
| 11    | Didaktik-Kompakt   |
| 12    | Spectrum +2        |
| 13    | Spectrum +2A       |
| 14    | TC2048             |
| 15    | TC2068             |
| 128   | TS2068             |

While most emulators using these extensions write version 3 files, some write version 2 files, so it's probably best to assume that any of these values may appear in version 2 or version 3 files.

If bit 7 of byte 37 is set, the hardware types are slightly modified: any 48K machine becomes a 16K machine, any 128K machine becomes a +2, and any +3 machine becomes a +2A.

The high **T** state counter counts upwards in modulo 4. Just after the ULA generates its interrupt once every 20 ms, the counter is 3 and increments by one every 5 ms of emulated time. In these intervals of 1/200 second, the lower **T** state counter counts down from 17471 to 0 (17726 in 128K modes), making a total of 69888 (70908) **T** states per frame.

The 5 ASCII words (the high byte is always 0) at offsets 73-82 are the keys corresponding to joystick directions: left, right, down, up, and fire, respectively. Shift, Symbol Shift, Enter, and Space are denoted by [,], /, \, respectively. The ASCII values are only used to display the joystick keys; the information in the 5 keyboard mapping words determines which key is actually pressed (and should correspond to the ASCII values). The low byte is in the range 0-7 and determines the keyboard row. The high byte is a mask byte and determines the column. Enter, for example, is stored as 0x0106 (row 6 and column 1), and 'g' as 0x1001 (row 1 and column 4).

Byte 60 must be zero because the contents of the Multiface RAM are not saved in the snapshot file. If the Multiface was paged when the snapshot was saved, the emulated program will likely crash when reloaded.

Bytes 61 and 62 are a function of the other flags, such as byte 34, 59, 60, and 83.

Next comes a series of memory blocks, each containing the compressed data of a 16K block. Compression is performed according to the old scheme, except the end marker is now absent. The structure of a memory block is:

| **Byte** | **Length** | **Description**         |
|----------|------------|-------------------------|
| 0        | 2          | Length of compressed data (not including this 3-byte header) |
|          |            | If length = 0xffff, the data is 16384 bytes long and uncompressed |
| 2        | 1          | Page number of the block |
| 3        | [0]        | Data                     |

Pages are numbered depending on the hardware mode as follows:

| **Page** | **In 48K mode** | **In 128K mode** | **In SamRam mode** |
|----------|-----------------|------------------|--------------------|
| 0        | 48K ROM         | Basic ROM        | 48K ROM            |
| 1        | Interface I ROM, Disciple or Plus D, depending on configuration. | (same as 48K)    | (same as 48K)      |
| 2        | -               | Reset ROM        | SamRam ROM (basic) |
| 3        | -               | Page 0           | SamRam ROM (monitor,..) |
| 4        | 8000-bfff       | Page 1           | Normal 8000-bfff   |
| 5        | c000-ffff       | Page 2           | Normal c000-ffff   |
| 6        | -               | Page 3           | Shadow 8000-bfff   |
| 7        | -               | Page 4           | Shadow c000-ffff   |
| 8        | 4000-7fff       | Page 5           | 4000-7fff          |
| 9        | -               | Page 6           | -                  |
| 10       | -               | Page 7           | -                  |
| 11       | Multiface ROM   | Multiface ROM    | -                  |

In 48K mode, pages 4, 5, and 8 are saved. In SamRam mode, pages 4 to 8 are saved. In 128K mode, all pages from 3 to 10 are saved. Pentagon snapshots are very similar to 128K snapshots, while Scorpion snapshots save all 16 pages of RAM in pages 3 to 18. There is no end marker.

### **Cases Where ROM is Included**

In 48K mode, although not common, it is possible to save page 0 (48K ROM).
